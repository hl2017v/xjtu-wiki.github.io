# About this wiki
New international students require a tremendous amount of guidelines and recommendations to adapt to new environment at XJTU due to language barrier and complicated regulations. New students that cannot seek help from their senior countrymates are more likely to have a hard time dealing with all the steps. This wiki is meant to be a complete source of information where international students in XJTU can rely on.
